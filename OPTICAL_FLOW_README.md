### Advanced Usage with Custom Parameters

```matlab
% Set custom parameters

params.polyN = 5;          % Polynomial neighborhood size (3, 5, or 7)
params.polySigma = 1.1;    % Gaussian sigma for polynomial expansion
params.winSize = 5;        % Averaging window size (3, 5, 7, ...)
params.numIters = 1;       % Number of iterations (1-3)
params.pyrScale = 0.5;     % Pyramid scale factor
params.numLevels = 2;      % Number of pyramid levels (1 for no pyramid)

% Compute flow
[u, v, mag, ang] = calcOpticalFlowFarneback_step2_hdl_wrapper(img0, img1, params);
```

## Algorithm Description

The Farneback algorithm estimates optical flow by:

1. **Polynomial Expansion**: Each pixel neighborhood is approximated by a quadratic polynomial
   ```
   f(x) = x'*A*x + b'*x + c
   ```
   where A is a 2x2 matrix, b is a 2D vector, and c is a scalar.

2. **Displacement Estimation**: Given polynomials for two consecutive frames, the algorithm estimates the displacement d that minimizes the difference between the warped polynomial expansions.

3. **Linear System**: This leads to a linear system at each pixel:
   ```
   2*A*d = -(b1 - b0)
   ```
   where subscripts 0 and 1 denote the two frames.

4. **Spatial Averaging**: The A and b terms are averaged over a neighborhood to improve robustness.

5. **Multi-scale Processing**: Optional pyramid approach handles large displacements.

## Parameters

- **polyN** (default: 5): Size of neighborhood for polynomial fitting. Larger values provide more robust fits but reduce spatial resolution.

- **polySigma** (default: 1.1): Standard deviation of Gaussian weights. Controls how much nearby pixels contribute to the polynomial fit.

- **winSize** (default: 5): Size of averaging window. Larger values provide smoother flow but may oversmooth fine details.

- **numIters** (default: 1): Number of refinement iterations. More iterations can improve accuracy but may amplify errors.

- **pyrScale** (default: 0.5): Scale factor between pyramid levels.

- **numLevels** (default: 1): Number of pyramid levels. Use multiple levels for large motions.

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```matlab
tb_print_uv_like_demo
```

This will execute 8 test cases:
1. Uniform horizontal motion
2. Uniform vertical motion
3. Diagonal motion
4. Expanding motion (zoom)
5. Identical images (zero flow)
6. Component validation
7. Multi-level pyramid
8. Visualization with vector field plot

## Performance Notes

- The algorithm is implemented in pure MATLAB/Octave without external dependencies
- Processing time scales with image size and number of pyramid levels
- For a 64x64 image with default parameters: ~0.3-0.5 seconds on modern hardware
- For real-time applications, consider using compiled versions or GPU acceleration

## Accuracy Notes

- Flow magnitude may be underestimated by 10-30% for small motions (< 5 pixels)
- Increasing `numIters` may improve accuracy but can also amplify errors
- Multi-scale processing helps with large motions but may introduce some scale bias
- The algorithm works best with textured images; uniform regions may produce noisy flow

## Dependencies

None! All functions are self-contained and work with base MATLAB or Octave.
